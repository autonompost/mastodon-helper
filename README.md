**a word of advice**

if you download attachments and use git it is better to use git lfs for the attachments. See the documentation on how to use git-lfs with your git remote service

if you don't use git lfs you will have to commit the attachments to your git repo which will bloat it and make it slow

else if you have significantly rewritten the script yourself and want to contribute please fork and open up a pull request or post me your script
